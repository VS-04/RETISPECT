Reti-Spect is an AI-powered tool designed for non-invasive retinal health diagnostics, leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to detect early signs of retinal diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This tool empowers healthcare providers to make quick, informed decisions with its real-time analysis capabilities and user-friendly interface. Built with data privacy in mind, Reti-Spect ensures that patient information is securely handled, without storing unnecessary personal health details.

To install Reti-Spect, first clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Install the dependencies with pip by running pip install -r requirements.txt. If certain services require API keys (e.g., cloud-based image processing), configure them by renaming .env.example to .env and inputting the required keys. Once setup is complete, you can analyze retinal images by running python main.py --input /path/to/image.jpg, which will process the image and display diagnostic findings in real-time.

Reti-Spect requires Python 3.8 or higher and is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. A minimum of 4GB RAM is needed, though 8GB is recommended for smoother operation. For contributions, fork the repository, create a new branch, and open a pull request after implementing and testing your changes.
